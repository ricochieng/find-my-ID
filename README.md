## Setup/Installation Requirements
The website does not need any unique/specific installation requirements. All that is required is the link to the live site that has been provided below. 

## Technologies Used
The website layout has been created using HTML and the styling and UI and business logic have been created using CSS and JavaScript and JQuery respectively.

## Known bugs
The only known bug so far is the lack of immediate return of the hidden user details upon clicking the submit button on the user registration page. The button has to be clicked twice to show the hidden div.
